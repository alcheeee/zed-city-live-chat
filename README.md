##### Zed City Live Chat

A simple script that will add a live chat to [Zed City](https://www.zed.city/).

Here's how it works, and a warning before you use.

Warning! People are able to change their username/faction that is sent to my server, accessing "private" faction chats, or using whatever username they want. As I do not have access to the Zed City servers, I cannot authenticate user data. Just don't be an a**hole. 

How it works,

    Your username and faction id will be intercepted from a Zed City response.
    My server takes in your username and faction id as authentication.
    Now your connected!

Features:
- Mention other users `@chee hello`
- Global chat (anyone with this script will be able to talk!)
- Global chat is cached up to 25 messages, though it's acting a bit weird right now -- will fix.
- "Private" faction chat

DISCLAIMER:
I am paying for the server out of pocket, therefore I have set low usage limits. If the server gets too loaded it will shut down and users will not be able to use the chat. I reserve the right to shut down the server at any point. If the developers of Zed City have a problem with this script, please reach out to me on discord.
